# Lilt

| Currently in the works! |
| - |

A proof-of-concept/working demo of a rhythm game based off EVAST9919's "Swing" ruleset
for osu!lazer, made with Godot 4.

Eventually, I would like to build a fully-fledged rhythm game out of this with my own
spin on it. This project exists to test the feasability of the concept for mobile devices.

## Installation

WIP

<!--

Download a pre-built binary through the
[Releases](https://github.com/markjoshwel/Lilt/releases) page, or using a link below.

| [Windows 7+ (64-bit)](https://github.com/markjoshwel/Lilt/releases/latest/download/lilt-windows.zip) | [Android 5+ (arm64-v8a)](https://github.com/markjoshwel/Lilt/releases/latest/download/lilt-android.zip) | [Data Pack](https://github.com/markjoshwel/Lilt/releases/latest/download/lilt-data.pck) |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |

Upgrading from an older version? Download the latest **Data Pack** and replace the old `lilt-data.pck` with it.

If your platform isn't available, you can clone the Git repository and export the Godot
project for your own platform. See the
[Godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/index.html) for more
information.

## Scores

_(Also known in other rhythm games as beatmaps, charts, levels, etc.)_

Lilt does not come with any pre-packaged scores due to potential copyright issues.
However, you may obtain **community-made** scores in
[this discussion page](https://github.com/markjoshwel/Lilt/discussions/1).

<!--
Lilt also comes with a built-in editor to create and share your own scores.
-->

### Technical Information

Scores are Godot Data Pack (*.pck) files containing three files:

- `meta.json`  
  JSON file containing all [song and timing metadata](#score-metadata)
- `song.mp3`
- `cover.jpg`

This can be done using the PCKPacker object in Godot.

#### Metadata

- Example:

  ```json
  {
  	"lilt file format version": 1,
  	"artist": "Loli in early 20s",
  	"title": "put the knife away",
  	"bpm": 89,
  	"signature": [4, 4],
  	"timings": [
  		[0, 4, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0]
  	] 
  }
  ```

Signature of `[4, 4]` is 

- `timings` Format:

  1. `bar_number` (int)
  2. `bar_count` (int)
  3. `note_length_numerator` (int)
  4. `note_length_denominator` (int)
  5. [`note_start_type`](#note-types) (int)
  6. [`note_end_type` ](#note-types) (int)
  7. extra data  
     currently used for repeat note end types to count times to repeat note

  Notes are treated as sliders if `note_end_type` is not `0`.

- Note Types

  0. Empty / Break (also used to determine if a note is a slider)
  1. Standard Note
  2. Flick Up
  3. Flick Right
  4. Flick Down
  5. Flick Left
  6. Repeat (only note_end_type)

  Examples in format `[note_start_type, note_end_type]`:

  - `[1, 0]`: Standard note
  - `[2, 0]`: Flick up note
  - `[1, 1]`: Standard slider
  - `[1, 2]`: Slider with flick up end
